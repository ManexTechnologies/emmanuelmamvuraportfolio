				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<h5>Aspiring Web Developer <span>& Software Engineer</span></h5>
				<p>
					I am a passionate Computer Science student at Midlands State University, focused on software development and web development. I have a strong foundation in programming, particularly in Python, Visual Basic, HTML and CSS and I enjoy creating projects that blend technical skills with creative problem-solving.<br><br>Recently, I completed a "SQL for Beginners" course with Alisson, which deepened my understanding of relational databases and data querying. This hands-on experience taught me to write efficient SQL queries, perform data analysis, and manage structured data using MySQL and PostgreSQL. The course emphasized the importance of data accuracy and collaborative problem-solving, enhancing my technical skills for both academic and personal projects.<br><br>As I continue my journey in the field of computer science, I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities that allow me to grow as a developer and innovator. My passion for technology drives me to constantly learn and adapt, and I am eager to contribute my skills to projects that make a meaningful impact. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and collaborating with like-minded individuals who share a commitment to leveraging technology for positive change.
